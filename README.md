An old project of mine. 
Unoptimised horrible code with bad architecture, but hey, it worked.

Biggest mistake was parsing json keys and turning them into readable names - took a lot of time.
Saving raw json and adding names later could've been much faster, but at one point it was too late to rewrite everything.


Uses celery and rabbitmq for scanning multiple profiles at once.

Django 1.8.3(?), MongoDB, MySQL (later Postgres).

Bot was written using node-steam, but source code was lost somewhere.


Total profit (08.2012 - 06.2015) - about 355 buds.
